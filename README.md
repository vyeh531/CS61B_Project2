# CS61B_Project2
In this project, we will build a browser based tool for exploring the history of word usage in English texts. We have provided the front end code (in Javascript and HTML) that collects user inputs and displays outputs. Your Java code will be the back end for this tool, accepting input and generating appropriate output for display.
